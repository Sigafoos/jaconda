Hi.

You probably don't need this. It's for sending [Telegram](https://web.telegram.org/) messages via [Jaconda](https://jaconda.im/) using [Slim](http://slimframework.com), so maybe that could be useful, but the actual implementations are stuff only my group of friends cares about. I tossed it on Github mostly so @mattgen88 can add to it if he wants.
